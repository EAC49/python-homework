# PyBank Homework 1

## Author - Emilio Cubero

## Instuctor / Class - Steve M/W/Sa

## Overview

A Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company.

Imports CSV named budget_data and analyzes the date and profit/loss columns to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.


When ran in the terminal, the python script exports the output to a text file.

## Challenges

Some of the challenges I faced in this homework were primarily commiting the homework with a proper commit message and creating a README file to describe the assignment.

I also faced some challenges with creating the proper logic used for the for loops and writing the output to a text file. After working through different versions of the for loops, I was able to create ones that gave me my desired output. Likewise, after reading the slack, I found the code I needed to write the output to a text file.

This homework covered many different concepts in python that can be applied to other use cases.
